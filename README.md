# RONIN Compiler

This package compiles [RONIN queries](https://ronin.co/docs/queries) to SQL statements.

## Setup

You don't need to install this package explicitly, as it is already included in the [RONIN client](https://github.com/ronin-co/client).

However, we would be excited to welcome your feature suggestions or bug fixes for the RONIN compiler. Read on to learn more about how to suggest changes.

## Contributing

To start contributing code, first make sure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed, which is a JavaScript runtime.

Next, [clone the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and install its dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Once that's done, link the package to make it available to all of your local projects:

```bash
bun link
```

Inside your project, you can then run the following command, which is similar to `bun add @ronin/compiler` or `npm install @ronin/compiler`, except that it doesn't install `@ronin/compiler` from npm, but instead uses your local clone of the package:

```bash
bun link @ronin/compiler
```

If your project is not yet compatible with [Bun](https://bun.sh), feel free to replace all of the occurrences of the word `bun` in the commands above with `npm` instead.

You will just need to make sure that, once you [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request) on the current repo, it will not contain a `package-lock.json` file, which is usually generated by npm. Instead, we're using the `bun.lockb` file for this purpose (locking sub dependencies to a certain version).

### Developing

The programmatic API of the RONIN compiler looks like this:

```typescript
import {
  compileQueries,

  type Query,
  type Schema,
  type Statement
} from '@ronin/compiler';

const queries: Array<Query> = [{
  get: {
    accounts: null
  }
}];

const schemas: Array<Schema> = [{
  slug: 'account'
}];

const statements: Array<Statements> = compileQueries(queries, schemas);

console.log(statements);
// [{
//   statement: 'SELECT * FROM "accounts" ORDER BY "ronin.createdAt" DESC LIMIT 101',
//   params: [],
//   returning: true,
// }]
```

#### Options

To fine-tune the behavior of the compiler, you can pass the following options:

```typescript
compileQueries(queries, schemas, {
  // Instead of returning an array of values for every statement (which allows for
  // preventing SQL injections), all values are inlined directly into the SQL strings.
  // This option should only be used if the generated SQL will be manually verified.
  inlineValues: true
});
```

#### Transpilation

In order to be compatible with a wide range of projects, the source code of the `compiler` repo needs to be compiled (transpiled) whenever you make changes to it. To automate this, you can keep this command running in your terminal:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Whenever you make a change to the source code, it will then automatically be transpiled again.

### Running Tests

The RONIN compiler has 100% test coverage, which means that every single line of code is tested automatically, to ensure that any change to the source code doesn't cause a regression.

Before you create a pull request on the `compiler` repo, it is therefore advised to run those tests in order to ensure everything works as expected:

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Alternatively, run a single test
bun test -t 'your test name'
```
